# About the project

The goal of the project was to create a simple cloud game with a client-server implementation.

The game runs on a server program that compresses the visual output using FFMPEG, and sends the video stream to the client.
The client receives the stream, decodes it, and shows it in a window. The client can also receive user interaction like keyboard strokes or mouse movements, and sends this back to the server program.
